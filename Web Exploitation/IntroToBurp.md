## Steps to Solve
1. I first downloaded the apk file to my Kali VM and began examining it using `file` but did not find anything useful
2. I wasn't entirely sure what to do next as I've never worked with an apk file before, so I tried to find a similar problem on YouTube and found [this John Hammond video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frrTYG6T_yw) that gave me the idea to extract the file using `unzip`
3. This gave me a bunch of different android files as well as some folders to search through:

4. I searched through both folders, however, I wasn't able to find any files that stood out to me
5. I decided to look at the hints provided on the pico website, but they didn't help much as the first one said `Did you know you can `unzip` APK files?` and the second one said `Now you have the whole host of shell tools for searching these files.`
6. I tried running a recursive grep command using `grep -r picoCTF` while inside the Mob Psycho directory that contained all of the apk files, but this did not return any results
7. I decided to take a break from this problem and come back to it later
