## Description
Why search for the flag when I can make a bookmarklet to print it for me? Browse [here](http://titan.picoctf.net:55173/), and find the flag!

## Steps to Solve
1. I first clicked on the site where I was met with a text box that contained a bookmarklet
2. As I had no idea what a bookmarklet was, I decided to look up a good way to paste and view them and came across [this blog by freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-are-bookmarklets/) that explained what bookmarklets are and what I can use them for
3. From here, I simply followed the steps to creating a bookmarklet by adding a new bookmark within my browser and pasting the javascript code I got from the problem description into the url text box
4. After creating the bookmark and opening it, I was met with a pop up that displayed to me the flag **picoCTF{p@g3_turn3r_1d1ba7e0}**
